* Linguistic Linked Data
There's been a huge drive in recent years to represent NLP data as RDF. NLP data is usually large, so does it make sense to represent it as RDF? What's the benefit?
- Ontologies, schemas and groups include: GRaF ITS2 FISE LAF LD4LT LEMON LIME LMF MARL NERD NIF NLP2RDF OLIA OntoLex OntoLing OntoTag Penn Stanford... my oh my!
- There are a lot of linguistic resources available that can be used profitably: BabelNet FrameNet GOLD ISOcat LemonUBY Multitext OmegaNet UBY VerbNet Wiktionary WordNet.
The benefit is that RDF offers a lot of flexibility for combining data on many different topics in one graph.

Examples (a few more are explained in Multisensor-NER-Mapping):
- [[./NIF-example.ttl]]: NLP data in RDF (Turtle). Covers NIF (text binding), OLIA (linguistic properties), Penn (POS tagging), Stanford (dependency parsing), ITS20 (semantic annotation), NERD (entity extraction classes), Stanbol/FISE (multiple NLP tools/annotations per word/phrase), MARL (opinion/sentiment); and use of entities from DBpedia, WordNet, YAGO.
  - [[./NIF-example.ttl.html]]: syntax-highlighted with Emacs 
  - [[./NIF-example.jsonld]]: same in JSONLD, shows that Turtle should be used for examples/discussion/QA and JSONLD for machine communication only
- [[./NIF-example2.ttl]]: example of NER as produced by LT (doesn't yet include all fields from the NER Mapping above).
  - [[./NIF-example2.ttl.html]]: syntax-highlighted with Emacs 
  - [[./NIF-example2.json]]: same in JSON-LD
- [[./NIF-example3.ttl]]: Various kinds of Named Entities as per Multisensor-NER-Mapping
  - [[./NIF-example3.ttl.html]]: syntax-highlighted with Emacs 
- [[./NIF-example4.ttl]]: sentiment with MARL
  - [[./NIF-example4.jsonld]]: same in JSONLD

Issues I've found in NIF: 
- [[https://github.com/NLP2RDF/specification/issues/1][Issue 1]]: nif:opinion vs marl:extractedFrom. Example: [[./NIF-issue-1.ttl]]
- [[https://github.com/NLP2RDF/specification/issues/2][Issue 2]]: itsrdf vs fise properties. Example: [[./NIF-issue-2.ttl]]

* Image Annotation
Look at this image: http://images.zeit.de/hamburg/stadtleben/2015-08/drage-vermisste/drage-vermisste-540x304.jpg\\
[[http://images.zeit.de/hamburg/stadtleben/2015-08/drage-vermisste/drage-vermisste-540x304.jpg][http://images.zeit.de/hamburg/stadtleben/2015-08/drage-vermisste/drage-vermisste-540x304.jpg]]

*NOTE:* It's recommended to copy the images to an internal server, to ensure that they
will be available in the future. If the above image disappears, any statements about its
URL become sort of useless.

CERTH has software that can annotate it with heuristic tags and confidence, eg like this
(many more tags are produced for this image):

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Concepts3_Or_More_People # 0.731893
Amateur_Video            # 0.884379
Armed_Person             # 0.35975 
#+END_SRC

We can represent this in RDF using various alternatives.

** Open Annotation
The [[http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/][Web Annotation Data Model]] (also known as Open Annotation, OA) is widely used for all
kinds of associating two or several resources: bookmarking, tagging, commenting,
annotating, transcription (associating the image of eg handwritten text with the
deciphered textual resources), compositing pieces of a manuscript (SharedCanvas), etc.

The OA ontology has gone through a huge number of revisions at various sites. To avoid confusion:
- The latest ontology is dated 2015-08-20 and is published at
  http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/vocabulary/wd/. It's still a draft (some editorial
  text is missing), but the ontology is usable
- The master file is at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/web-annotation/gh-pages/vocabulary/oa.ttl
- The namespace URL http://www.w3.org/ns/oa serves an *obsolete* version

We represent image annotations as [[http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#semantic-tags][oa:SemanticTag]]:
- The image is the *target*, tags are (linked to)*bodies*
- The tags are expressed as ~oa:SemanticTag~. The construct of using ~skos:related~ is
  doubtful and [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-annotation/2015Sep/0184.html][will likely be removed]], but for now we'll use it
- OA asks us to describe the nature of the relation as a specific [[http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivations][oa:motivatedBy]]. In this
  case I picked *oa:tagging*.
- We state the nature of the resource as rdf:type dctype:Image, and its mime type as
  dc:format.
- We record basic creation (provenance) information.
[[./annot-image-oa.ttl]]\\
[[./img/annot-image-oa.png]]

Unfortunately OA has no standard way to express confidence, which is essential for this
use case. I have raised this as https://github.com/restful-open-annotation/spec/issues/3.
Above we use a custom property *ms:confidence*, and in further subsections I show other
options.

** Representing Confidence with Stanbol FISE
Apache Stanbol defines an "enhancement structure" using the FISE ontology, which amongst
other things defines ~fise:confidence~. We want to use [[http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/enhancementstructure.html#fisetopicannotation][fise:TopicAnnotation]] that goes like
this:\\
http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/es_topicannotation.png

As you see, it points to ~fise:TextAnnotation~ using ~dc:relation~; if [[http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/enhancementstructure.html#overview-on-the-stanbol-enhancement-structure][you scroll to the
top]], you'll see that points further to the (textual) annotated resource
(~ContentItem~): we don't want that since we have image not text. But there are
also ~fise:extracted-from~ (dashed arrows) pointing directly to the resource. The
*NIF+Stanbol* profile shows the same idea of using ~fise:extracted-from~ directly:\\
#+ATTR_HTML: :style width:800px; text-align:left
[[./20141008-Linguistic-LD/img/NIF-profiles.png]]

We bastardize the ontology a bit:
- skip ~dc:relation~, as we don't have ~fise:TextAnnotation~
- skip ~fise:entity-label~, as it just repeats skos:prefLabel of the concept
- skip ~fise:entity-type~, as it just repeats the rdf:type of the concept
- make a direct link ~fise:extracted-from~ to the content. TODO: this is redundant since
  ~oa:hasTarget~ already points there. So we can skip it
The result is: [[./annot-image-fise.ttl]]\\
[[./img/annot-image-fise.png]]

** Representing Confidence with FAM
The FusePoolP3 Annotation Model (FAM) has invesigated merging of OA, NIF and Stanbol FISE, and defines ~fam:confidence~ that we can use. Some links:
- https://github.com/fusepoolP3/overall-architecture/blob/master/wp3/fp-anno-model/fp-anno-model.md
- http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ApacheCon-Stanbol-FAM.pdf
- http://www.slideshare.net/linkedtv/linking-media-and-data-using-apache-marmotta-lime-workshop-keynote 
- https://github.com/wikier/apache-marmotta-tutorial-iswc2014

We would use fam:TopicAnnotation: see a mapping from [[https://github.com/fusepoolP3/overall-architecture/blob/master/wp3/fp-anno-model/fp-anno-model.md#famTopicClassification_transformation][fise:TopicAnnotation to fam:TopicAnnotation]]. But because this results in an isomorphic graph structure, we don't show it here.

** Representing Confidence with Reification
*(IMPORTANT: Ignore this section, it's not needed now.)*

A tried and true (although criticized by some) way of adding statements to relations is
[[http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/reified-statement.html][RDF Reification]] that uses ~rdf:Statement, rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, rdf:object~ (a lot
more details in [[https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-rdf/0596002637/ch04s03.html][Practical RDF # Reification: The RDF Big Ugly]] at O'Reilly Safari. For
brevity we represent only one of the tags. It looks like this, but the diagram hides some
of the complexity so please see the turtle: [[./annot-image-reif.ttl]]\\
[[./img/annot-image-reif.png]]

* Social Linked Data
SMAP is a MS module that does network analysis over social networks.
It gets some tweets based on keywords or hashtags, and then determines the importance of various posters:
- ms:has_page_rank
- ms:has_reachability
- ms:has_global_influence: a comnbination of the two

** Example: single keywords
- We crawled two sets of tweets based on two *keywords*: "cars" and "RDF"
- The first guy (~valexiev1~) has posted on both topics. He knows a bit about "cars" but a lot about "RDF"
- The second guy (~johnSmith~) has posted only on the "cars" topic. He knows a lot about "cars".
(These names are completely random ;-).

Representation:
- We use a namespace ~mssoc:~ where we put MS Social network data.
- The RDF representation follows the [[http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/][SIOC]] ontology, complemented with MS properties where needed.
- Keywords are strings, so we use dc:subject to express them.
- The graph allows a journalist to compare the importance of the same poster across keywords
[[./SMAP-example.ttl]] ([[./SMAP-example.ttl.html]] is syntax highlighted):\\
[[./img/SMAP-example.png]]

** Example: multiple hashtags
- We crawled one set of tweets based on multiple *hashtags*.
- We make the topic URLs by concatenating the sorted tags (a bit too long but works).
- We don't have the user names, only user IDs.
- Hashtags are resources (separately addressable), so we use dct:subject to express them
- We put each hashtag in a separate dct:subject. This would allow someone to analyze topic  intersection.
[[./SMAP-example2.ttl]] ([[./SMAP-example2.ttl.html]] is syntax highlighted):\\
[[./img/SMAP-example2.png]]

TODO:
- Decide whether to split into more coherent hashtag groups, and do separate analyses. Eg:
  - energy_crisis.energy_policy.renewable vs
  - dishwasher.homeappliances
- Decide whether and what named graphs to use. For now we'll use just one, with URL ~mssoc:~

** Tweets Related to Article   
Assume we can collect tweets related to a crawled article (SIMMO).
- Assume that "energiewende" is a major topic of SIMMO http://data.multisensorproject.eu/content/1983754939468 (this URL is made up and doesn't resolve)
- The tweet http://twitter.com/MSR_Future/status/605786079153627136 talks about #energiewende
We can express the tweet as sioc:Post. We'll express just basic data:
- sioc:content: "@UNFCCC @EnergiewendeGER That's great, just a shame it does not translate into lower CO2. #Energiewende"
- sioc:has_creator: http://twitter.com/MSR_Future (or if we don't have access to the user name, we can use the user id just like above).
- dct:date: posted on 2 Jun 2015 at 8:20 PM
TODO: it would be nice to extract the hashtags and mentions

[[./SMAP-tweet.ttl]]:\\
[[./img/SMAP-tweet.png]]

Possible extensions:
- If we start sourcing ~Posts~ from other places (eg Facebook), we should link the ~Post~
  and ~UserAccount~ to *twitter:* as a ~sioc:Forum~ or ~sioc:Site~.
- If we want to express more diverse relations than a general ~sioc:about~, we can use OA
  (see [[*Open Annotation]]) and oa:motivatedBy. The SIMMO will be the *target* of annotation,
  and the tweet is the *body*.
