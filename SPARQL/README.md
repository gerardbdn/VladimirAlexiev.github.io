This tool is quite good: it can scrape EBNF grammars from W3C specs, generates either a single XHTML with embedded SVG, or a zip with many PNGs, cross-links the definitions and usages.

# Results
* [sparql11-grammar.xhtml](sparql11-grammar.xhtml): It's hard to understand since there is one diagram per production (173 total). So you can use this for reference, but not for learning SPARQL.
* Here's a chunked diagram, which however is partial: http://ontologicalengineering.blogspot.com/2008/12/sparql-railroad-diagram-from-hell.html. (Discussion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15758282/bigger-granularity-railroad-diagram-generator)
* [sparql11-grammar.ebnf](sparql11-grammar.ebnf): 
* [sparql11-grammar.txt](sparql11-grammar.txt): same thing but with production numbers from the standard
