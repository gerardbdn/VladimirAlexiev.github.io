* Semantic Technologies
- *Web 1.0*: hyperlinked documents (World Wide Web)
- *Web 2.0*: interactive applications, the Social Web
- *Web 3.0*: interlinked data (Global Giant Graph)
Is this something new?
- It was all envisioned by Sir Tim Berners-Lee 25 years ago
- Standardized by W3C: both HTML and sem web standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL...)
- Great flurry of sem tech activity in the last 15 years
- Buzzwords: Big Data, Semantic Analytics, Concept Extraction, Sentiment Analysis...
** Linked Open Data Cloud
- Parts at [[http://factforge.net][factforge.net]], [[http://linkedlifedata.com][linkedlifedata.com]]. Grown 10x since Mar 2009!

** CRM Search (Fundamental Relations)
CRM data comprises complex graphs of nodes and properties.
- How can a user search through such complex graphs?
- The number of possible combinations is staggering
FC/FR Approach:
- New Framework for Querying Semantic Networks ([[https://www.ics.forth.gr/tech-reports/2011/2011.TR419_Querying_Semantic_Networks.pdf][FORTH TR419, 2011]]) 
- Fundamental Categories and Relationships for intuitive querying CIDOC-CRM based repositories ([[http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/TechnicalReport429_April2012.pdf][FORTH TR-429, Apr 2012]], 153 pages)
- "Compresses" the semantic network by mapping networks of CRM properties to single FRs
- FRs serve as a "search index" over the CRM semantic web
- Allow the user to use a simpler query vocabulary
** CRM Fundamental Relations Matrix
- 114 FRs over all combinations of FCs; 18 "specialization FRs"

** Example: Thing from Place
How a Thing's *origin* can be related to Place (* = recursion)
- Thing (part of another)* considered to be "from" Place if:
- is formerly or currently located at Place (falling in another)*
- or was brought into existence (produced/created) by an Event (part of another)*
  - that happened at Place (falling in another)*
  - or was carried out by an Actor (who is member of a Group)*
    - who formerly or currently has residence at Place (falling in another)*
    - or was brought into existence (born/formed) by an Event (part of another)* that happened at Place (falling in another)*
- or was Moved to/from a Place (falling in another)*
- or changed ownership through an Acquisition (part of another)*
  - that happened at Place (falling in another)*

** FR Implementation as OWLIM Rules
- OWL2 doesn't have conjunctive properties
- So we implemented with OWLIM rules, using the parallel/sequential decompositions above
- Details: [[https://confluence.ontotext.com/display/ResearchSpace/FR%2BImplementation][FR Implementation]]
- Implemented 19 FRs of Thing (see [[https://confluence.ontotext.com/display/ResearchSpace/Meta-Thesaurus%2Band%2BFR%2BNames#Meta-ThesaurusandFRNames-SpecialFRs][FR Names]]):
  - refers to or is about Place; from Place; is/was located in Place
  - has met Actor; by Actor
  - refers to or is about Event; has met Event
  - is made of Material; is/has Type; used technique; identified by Identifier
- Use 44 CRM properties. Took 86 rules, 10 axioms, 26 sub-FRs (gray on next slide)
- Refactoring idea: http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pres/extending-owl2/index.html

* Getty Vocabularies LOD
Well-known and important cultural heritage thesauri:
- Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)
- Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)
- Unified List of Artist Names (ULAN)
- Cultural Object Names Authority (CONA)
Ontotext helps Getty publish them as LOD: http://vocab.getty.edu
- AAT published Feb 2014, already sees numerous use cases
- TGN published Aug 2014
- Continuing with ULAN, CONA; AATA (bibliography), Getty Museum data
- Special session at CIDOC Congress (Dresden, Sep 2014)
** Getty External Ontologies
- SKOS, SKOSXL, ISO 25964 for representing thesaurus info;
- DC, DCT for common properties;
- BIBO, FOAF for sources and contributors;
- WGS, Schema for geographic information;
- PROV for revision history;
- RDF, RDFS, OWL, XSD for system properties;
- R2RML for implementing the conversion.
** Getty Semantic Representation
- Covers subjects (concepts, guide terms...),
  hierarchical rels, associative rels, historic info,
  labels, sources, contributors, revision history, languages ...

** Use of ISO 25946 in Getty LOD
Latest standard on thesauri: ISO 25946. Use Thesaurus Array for ordered children
[[./img/Getty-isoThesaurusArray.png]]
** Contribution to ISO 25946
- Contributed to ISO 25946 ontology: http://purl.org/iso25964/skos-thes
- See [[http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/details/vocabulary_iso-thes.html][Linked Open Vocabularies entry]]
- First industrial use of ISO 25946
- Defined appropriate combinations of BTG, BTP, BTI relations (first formally defined in ISO).

- Text analytics and semantic annotation of CH records
- Linguistic Linked Data
- Manuscripts: semantic integration, semantic search, semantic annotation 
- Research Infrastructures
