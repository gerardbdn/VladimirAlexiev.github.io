While working on ULAN LOD, I wondered how should we map the ULAN sex field.

So I did a small review of available LOD properties and values. 

Everyone agrees on male/female but there are other values as well.
Read the discussion on Wikidata prop [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P21#Transgender_.2F_Cisgender_changes][sex or gender (P21)]] to learn more than you ever wanted on the topic, including the difference between sex and gender.

** How Many in Wikidata?
How many Wikidata entities have gender but are neither male nor female?
We can check with this cryptic query:
: CLAIM[21] AND NOCLAIM[21:6581097] AND NOCLAIM[21:6581072] AND NOCLAIM[21:4294967294]  AND NOCLAIM[21:44148] AND NOCLAIM[21:43445]
Use the [[http://wdq.wmflabs.org/wdq/][WDQ Editor]] to "click a query", or paste the above query to figure out what it means.
[[./WDQ-gender.png]]

- the values that we exclude with NOCLAIM are (in order): male, female, unknown, male animal, female animal
- Wikidata distinguishes between human and animal males/females.
  If you skip the last 2 NOCLAIM, you can find out that both Laika (the first space dog) and Blondi (Hitler's dog) were female

Then invoke [[http://tools.wmflabs.org/autolist/autolist1.html?q%3DCLAIM%5B21%5D%20AND%20NOCLAIM%5B21%3A6581097%5D%20AND%20NOCLAIM%5B21%3A4294967294%5D%20AND%20NOCLAIM%5B21%3A6581072%5D%20AND%20NOCLAIM%5B21%3A44148%5D%20AND%20NOCLAIM%5B21%3A43445%5D][Autolist]], add "Property: 21" and click Update to get a Gender column.
Currently there are 163 humans that have gender neither male nor female. Eg
- the artist Jeffrey Catherine Jones is "transgender female";
- the author, poet, playwright, and theater artist S. Bear Bergman is "transgender male".

Now let's find out how many humans have a gender (excluding unknown,  male animal, female animal).
Since there's a lot, we use the [[http://wdq.wmflabs.org/api_documentation.html][WDQ API]] to just count, returning "noitems":
: http://wdq.wmflabs.org/api?q=CLAIM[21] AND NOCLAIM[21:4294967294] AND NOCLAIM[21:44148] AND NOCLAIM[21:43445]&noitems=1

There are 2,516,099. So the ones neither male nor female are 0.0065% (6.5 promiles). This is quite low.
But studies have shown that all authority lists (VIAF, Wikipedia, Wikidata) are strongly male-biased.
So in a more harmonious future we should expect the percentage of records and articles about females and transgenders to increase.

* Survey of Datasets

** ULAN
The ULAN database field "sex" has these values:
- Male
- Female.
- Other: neither male nor female (eg hermaphrodite)
ULAN includes a few <named animals> under ulan:500353455, for which also male/female is used.

The following values won't be used
- Transgender: will be replaced with Other
- Unknown: the default for loads, when gender is not indicated by the contributor or otherwise we do not know it. Will be skipped
- N/A: for corporate bodies. Will be skipped

** AAT
ULAN refers to AAT for all sorts of concepts (person type, life event type, sex).
The following concepts will be used (first two are under [[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATHierarchy?find%3D300189557&logic%3DAND&note%3D&subjectid%3D300055146][AAT concept Sex]]):
- aat:300189559 male
- aat:300189557 female
- aat:300400513 other

AAT also has a concept that won't be used
- aat:300389935 hermaphroditic "combining male and female characteristics".

** FOAF and Schema
- [[http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_gender][foaf:gender]] is literal, with recommended values "male", "female" and "other values may be used, but are not enumerated here"
- [[http://schema.org/gender][schema:gender]] is literal, with no recommended values

** RDA 
The RDA [[http://rdvocab.info/termList/gender][termList/gender]] is not yet online but is [[https://github.com/vocabhub/RDVocab/blob/master/termList/gender.rdf][available on github]]. It has these limited values:
- 1002 male
- 1001 female
- 1003 not known

I wonder what RDA would say for the aforementioned S. Bear Bergman ([[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q185735][wd:Q185735]], [[https://viaf.org/viaf/26494357/][viaf:26494357]]).

** Wikidata
Wikidata prop [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P21][sex or gender (P21)]] has the most recommended values:
- for persons: male (Q6581097), female (Q6581072), intersex (Q1097630), hermaphrodite (Q303479), transgender (Q189125), transgender female (Q1052281), transgender male (Q2449503), genderqueer (Q48270), fa'afafine (Q1399232), māhū (Q3277905), kathoey (Q746411), fakaleiti (Q350374), hijra (Q660882) ; 
- for animals: male animal (Q44148) or female animal (Q43445)

I [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P21#Hermaphrodite_and_Transgender][added two values]]: Hermaphrodite and Transgender:
- hermaphrodite (Q303479): described as "used for organisms with both 'male' and 'female' reproductive organs" and coreferenced to GND 4191351-6
  - note: intersex (Q1097630) is described as "variation in sex characteristics that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female". It's coreferenced to GND 4027484-6 "occurrence of male and female or intermediate characteristics in an individual of a single sex type", which has synonym *Pseudo*-hermaphroditism so it's not the same as Hermaphrodite
- transgender (Q189125): while there exist transgender male (Q2449503) and transgender female (Q1052281), ULAN doesn't have such distinction, so we need a "super-value" Transgender in addition to these two

* Coreferencing
One can use the following coreferencing statements for male/female
