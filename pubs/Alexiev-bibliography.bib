  abstract     = {One of the most difficult problems on the way to an integration of Object-Oriented and Logic Programming is the modeling of changeable object state(i.e. object dynamics) in a particular logic in order not to forfeit the declarative nature of LP. Classical logic is largely unsuitable for such a task, because it adopts a general (both temporally and spatially), Platonic notion of validity, whereas object state changes over time and is local to an object. This paper presents the problem and surveys the state-of-the-art approaches to its solution, as well as some emerging, promising new approaches. The paper tries to relate the different approaches, to evaluate their merits and deficiencies and to identify promising directions for development. The emphasis in this survey is on efficient implementation of state change, one which would be suitable for the lowest fundamental level of a general OOLP language. The following approaches are covered: Assert/Retract, Declarative Database Updates and Transaction Logic, Modal and Dynamic Logics, Perpetual Objects, Logical Objects and Linear Objects, Linear Logic, Rewriting Logic and MaudeLog.},

In LO each object is represented by a separate open node of a proof tree. This ``insulates'' objects from one another which allows the attributes of an object to be represented as a multiset of atoms and thus facilitates easy retrieval and update of attributes. However this separation hinders communication between objects. Communication in LO is achieved through broadcasting to all objects which in our opinion is infeasible from a computational viewpoint. This paper proposes a refined communication mechanism for LO which uses explicit communication channels specified by the programmer. We name it TCLO which stands for ``Targeted Communication in LO''. Although channel specification puts some burden on the programmer, we demonstrate that the language is expressive enough by redoing some of the examples given for LO. Broadcasting can be done in a controlled manner. LO can be seen as a special case of TCLO where only one global channel (the forum) is used.},

Information Grids should allow for the effective access, extraction and linking of dispersed information. Currently Europe’s coporations spend over 10 Billion € to deal with these problems. This book will demonstrate the applicability of grid technologies to industry. To this end, it gives a detailed insight on how on tology technology can be used to manage dispersed information assets more efficiently. The book is based on experiences from the COG (Corporate Ontology Grid) project, carried out jointly by three leading industrial players and the Digital Enterprise Research Institute Austria. Through comparisons of this project with alternative technologies and projects, it provides hands-on experience and best practice examples to act as a reference guide for their development. Information Integration with Ontologies: Ontology based Information Integration in an Industrial Setting is ideal for technical experts and computer researchers in the IT-area looking to achieve integration of heterogeneous information and apply ontology technologies and techniques in practice. It will also be of great benefit to technical decision makers seeking infor mation about ontology technologies and the scientific audience, interested in achievements towards the application of ontologies in an industrial setting.},

CRM data is usually represented in semantic web format (RDF) and comprises complex graphs of nodes and properties.
An important question is how a user can search through such complex graphs, since the number of possible combinations is staggering. One approach "com-presses" the semantic network by mapping many CRM entity classes to a few "Fundamental Concepts" (FC), and mapping whole networks of CRM proper-ties to fewer "Fundamental Relations" (FR). These FC and FRs serve as a "search index" over the CRM semantic web and allow the user to use a simpler query vocabulary.
We describe an implementation of CRM FR Search based on OWLIM Rules, done as part of the ResearchSpace (RS) project. We describe the technical de-tails, problems and difficulties encountered, benefits and disadvantages of using OWLIM rules, and preliminary performance results. We provide implementa-tion experience that can be valuable for further implementation, definition and maintenance of CRM FRs.},
